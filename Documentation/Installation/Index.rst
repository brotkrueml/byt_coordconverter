Target group: **Administrators**

.. note::

   The extension in the recent version works with TYPO3 8 LTS, TYPO3 9 LTS and TYPO3 10.0.

   Use version 1.0.5 for TYPO3 7 LTS from the `TYPO3 Extension Repository <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/byt_coordconverter/>`__.

The recommended way to install this extension is by using Composer. In your Composer-based TYPO3 project root, just type

.. code-block:: bash

   composer req brotkrueml/coordconverter

and the latest stable release will be installed.

But you can also install the extension the classic way from the TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER).
