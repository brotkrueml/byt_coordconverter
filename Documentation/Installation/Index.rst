.. note::

   The extension in version 3.x needs at least PHP 7.4 and supports
   TYPO3 v9 LTS, TYPO3 v10 LTS and TYPO3 v11 LTS.

   Use version 2.1.3 for TYPO3 v8 LTS or older PHP versions.

   Use version 1.0.5 for TYPO3 v7 LTS from the
   `TYPO3 Extension Repository <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/byt_coordconverter/>`_.

The recommended way to install this extension is by using Composer. In your
Composer based TYPO3 project root, just type

.. code-block:: bash

   composer req brotkrueml/coordconverter

and the latest stable release will be installed.

But you can also install the extension the classic way from the TYPO3
Extension Repository (TER).
